Notes---------------------------------
We provided our API key to you for ease of use but if for some reason it
does not work, we included a link to get a new API key for free.

Also in some rare cases the API can bug out and cause one of the code blocks
to have an error, if you run it again it should fix it.

Since our program bases the results on data up to the current date, our results
will not perfectly match any that are not performed on the same day. Keep in
mind that due to market instability the BERT accuracy kinda fluctuates
depending on whatever is going on due to political factors.
